Schools Analysis
The City’s school district has two types of schools Independent and Government. The Government schools serve a greater number of students compared to independent schools, though the ‘Per Student Budget’ is high in Government schools compared to independent Schools.
The Government school’s absence in mean Maths score associated to reading, has resulted in a lesser % Passing in Maths. As a result, their overall Passing % becomes much lesser than the aggregate Passing % of standard.
On the other hand, independent schools uphold a good mean score in both Maths and Reading, hence leading to a much higher aggregate Passing % compared to the standard %

The top performing Schools (by % aggregate passing): The independent schools top the performance list across the City’s school district board. 

Least performing Schools (By % aggregate Passing): The Government schools held the lowest performance positions across the City’s school district board.
Average Math Scores are consistent across grades in any school. There is no massive variance seen within a school but across schools the Maths score is changing while reading scores are reliable within school and across schools


In conclusion I can say: - 
 - schools that spent less per student produced greater results overall and reliable across subjects in   comparison to schools that spend more (Per Student). 
 - The data also explains that the smaller and medium schools outclassed larger schools in Math 
 - hence independent schools have outclassed government schools.
